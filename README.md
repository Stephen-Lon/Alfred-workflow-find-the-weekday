# Alfred-workflow-find-the-weekday
A simple workflow to return immediately the day of the week for a given date

This is a simple workflow which will provide instantly the weekday of a given date. Just type the keyword (the default is `wday`) and <space>. Then type the date in accordance with the format you have chosen in the configuration and the result will be displayed in Alfred's window.

The workflow configuration (version 1.2 and later) allows you to select the European date format (dd/mm/yyyy), the US date format (mm/dd/yyyy) or the ISO date format (yyyy-mm-dd).

The workflow does nothing more nor less than that.  If you type a wayward date you will be prompted simply to enter a date in the correct format.
